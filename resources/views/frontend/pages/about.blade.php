                                    I think, in the era of globalization and information technology, the world has turned
                                    into a global village with communication and connectivity – the ultimate key to
                                    development and economic emancipation. Moreover, globalization and its all-pervasive
                                    impact on states and their economies have made life more competitive, complex and
                                    technology-driven. With the economy as the main focus of national development, proximity
                                    has turned meaningless and thus, globalization has become the key tool for economic
                                    sustainability. Inter-state trade dependence, investment potentials and free flow of
                                    information and raw materials have made the world thrive on the edge of competitiveness.
                                    I am sure ‘staying competitive’ is the key to survival in today’s world of business,
                                    where quality rules and standard products and services sneak in, shedding physical
                                    boundaries. Moreover, the recent economic changes and their impacts have posed yet
                                    another challenge and exposed the other side of globalization. But despite the global
                                    challenges and their impacts on the local economy, Prime Asset Group has kept on its
                                    forward march with a visionary goal.
                                    As you know, the diverse range of products with ensured standards, quality services, and
                                    most effective managerial efficiency have made the company a market leader in the
                                    respective sectors of its operation. Keeping the main focus on business expansion and
                                    growth in the most prospective sectors, the group is continuously taking up projects to
                                    make it the largest conglomerate in the business arena of Bangladesh despite
                                    fast-changing business trends. Relying on the firm foundation and highly professional
                                    human resources, the Prime Asset Group is still making good use of its business
                                    potential and also contributing to the development of the local corporate culture and
                                    making a significant contribution to the overall development of the country and its
                                    economy.
                                    However, despite intriguing growth and business expansion, the company’s aims and
                                    objectives remain the same – to serve people with maximum satisfaction and keep up the
                                    strive for the greater welfare of the people and the country. Still, every company of
                                    the Prime Asset Group cares for their clients as their obligation, and the highest
                                    customer satisfaction remains the key to our success.
                                    As a custodian of the Prime Asset Group, I hope that the cordial relations with all the
                                    valued clients will remain intact as partners of prosperity, and we also look forward to
                                    developing more successful relations with potential clients in the future. It will
                                    certainly help us grow and serve the stakeholders even better in the days ahead.
